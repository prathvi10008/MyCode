\section{Introduction}
Theorems can be easily defined:
\begin{theorem}
Let  f be a function whose derivative exists in every point,then f is a continuous function
\end{theorem}
\begin{theorem}
\label{pythagorean}
Pythagorean theorem This is a theorem about right angled triangles and can be summarized in the next equation \[x^2+y^2=z^2\]
\end{theorem}
And a consequence of theorem \ref{pythagorean} is the statement in the next corollary
\begin{corollary}
There's no right triangle whose side measure is 3cm,4cm and 6cm
\end{corollary}
You can reference theorem such as \ref{pythagorean} when a label is assigned
\begin{lemma}
Given two line segments whose lengths are a and b respectively there is a real number r such that b=ra
\end{lemma}
